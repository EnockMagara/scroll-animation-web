# UP. DOWN. REPEAT. â€” Enock's Day at Campus

A brutalist, scroll-animated webpage showcasing the gritty, bold moments from Enock's routine at NYUAD. This immersive experience uses harsh typography, limited color palette, oversized elements, and jarring animations to create an intentionally intense but expressive journey through a typical day.


*Built with intentional harshness. Designed to make you feel something.*
